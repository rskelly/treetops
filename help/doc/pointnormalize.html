        <h1>Point Normalization</h1>
        <p>The pointnormalize-app tool normalizes point cloud data by subtracting the
            terrain elevation from the height of a non-ground point. This is useful
            for the computation of <a href="pointstats.html">biometrics</a> and the
            creation of canopy height models.</p>
        <p>Point normalization is performed by constructing a Delaunay triangulation
            using the ground points and interpolating the ground elevation at every
            non-ground point from this "terrain" surface.</p>
        <p>Currently, this tool accepts LAS files.</p>
        <p>To normalize a point cloud:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start the pointnormalize-app.</li>
            <li>Click the "Add" button to add LAS files to the Input Files list.</li>
            <li>Click the "..." button to set the Output Folder. New normalized
                files will be created here.</li>
            <li>Click "Keep" or "Remove" depending on whether you wish to discard
                ground points or keep them.</li>
            <li>Click "Keep" or "Remove" depending on whether you wish to discard
                negative-elevation non-ground points or keep them.</li>
            <li>Check "Overwrite Output" if you wish to overwrite the files in the 
                output folder. <strong>Take care not to overwrite the source files.</strong></li>
            <li>Select the number of threads of execution.</li>
            <li>Select a buffer. The buffer expands the triangulation construction
                using points from neighbouring files to ensure that no non-ground
                point is outside the triangulation for the current block. Too large
                a buffer will consume extra time and memory. </li>
            <li>Click "Run".</li>
        </ol>
