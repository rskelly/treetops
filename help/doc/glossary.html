        <p>Canopy Height Model (CHM): A raster representing the top of the canopy,
            usually derived from LiDAR. The raster will have been normalized by
            subtracting the terrain surface elevation, leaving each pixel value
            to represent the height of the vegetation or other non-ground objects.</p>
